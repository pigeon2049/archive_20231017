Overfitting occurs when a model fits training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization and incorrect predictions. It can be caused by noisy data, insufficient training data, or overly complex models. To prevent overfitting, collecting more training data, using regularization techniques, and employing ensemble methods are recommended.
