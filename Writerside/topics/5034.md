Angular 17 introduces a new feature called deferred loading, which enhances user experience by reducing initial page load time and allowing users to interact with the app as soon as possible. Angular 17 also introduces @defer control blocks, allowing lazy-loading of content and its dependencies. The @defer blocks can be triggered by logical expressions or declarative trigger conditions such as on interaction, on hover, on idle, on timer, and on viewport.
