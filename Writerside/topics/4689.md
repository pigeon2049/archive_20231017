China may continue to see some market volatility but the worst has passed, the former head of benchmark giant FTSE Russell said. “China has had success, and will become an important investment venue going forward, but in the short term, China does have some issues. We’re not seeing the sort of growth in the market we’ve seen in the past, but the potential is there,” Mark Makepeace, who is now the chief executive officer of Wilshire Indexes, told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia.”
