React Router is a library that helps in handling navigation and routing in a React application. It allows you to define different routes in your app and link them to their respective components without reloading the page. React Router provides complex navigation, seamless page navigation structure, and support for dynamic URLs. To set up React Router, you need to install the react-router-dom package, wrap your app's components with the BrowserRouter component, define routes using the Route component, and use the Link or NavLink component for navigation between routes.
